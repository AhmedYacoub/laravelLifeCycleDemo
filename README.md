# Laravel-like Life Cycle Demo
This is a very simple and basic life cycle of a get request through routes, controllers, models... to get data.

# Install instructions:
1. clone the project.
2. cd to project directory.
3. run `composer install` this will take care of classes autoloading.
4. run `php index.php` to see the results.

## P.S you could check the examples at `index.php` and try to edit them to get the basic idea.
